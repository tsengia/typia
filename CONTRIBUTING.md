# Contribution Guide
## To Publish an issue
Thanks for your advise. Before publishing an issue, please check some components.

### 1. Search for duplicates
Before publishing an issue, please check whether the duplicated issue exists or not.

  - [Ordinary Issues](https://github.com/samchon/typia/issues)

### 2. Did you find a bug?
When you reporting a bug, then please write about those items:

  - What version you're using
  - If possible, give me an isolated way to reproduce the behavior.
  - The behavior your expect to see, and the actual behavior.

### 3. Do you have a suggestion?
I always welcome your suggestion. When you publishing a suggestion, then please write such items: 

  - A description of the problem you're trying to solve.
  - An overview of the suggested solution.
  - Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places.
    - Code examples showing the expected behavior.




## Contributing Code
### Test your code
Before sending a pull request, please test your new code. 

Because Typia utilizes TypeScript transforms to generate code, the test suite also undergoes transformation via Typia.
This means that testing Typia requires the following steps:
1. Compile Typia itself
2. Use Typia to generate the test suite
3. Run the test suite

These three steps can be accomplished with the following commands:
```bash
# COMPILE TYPIA
npm run build

# GENERATE THE TEST SUITE
npm run test:generate

# RUN THE TEST SUITE
npm run test
```

If you succeeded to compile, but failed to pass the test-automation, then *debug* the test-automation module. 

### Adding a Test
If you want to add a testing-logic, then goto the `src/test` directory. It's the directory containing the test-automation module. Declare some functions starting from the prefix `test_`. Then, they will be called after the next testing.

Note that, the special functions starting from the prefix `test_` must be `export`ed. They also must return one of them:
  - `void`
  - `Promise<void>`

When you detect an error, then throw exception such below:

```typescript
import typia from "typia"
import { RandomGenerator } from "typia/lib/utils/RandomGenerator";

export function test_stringify_object_recursive(): void
{
    const department: IDepartment = {
        name: RandomGenerator.string(),
        parent: {
            name: RandomGenerator.string(),
            parent: {
                name: RandomGenerator.string(),
                parent: null
            }
        }
    };

    const json: string = typia.json.stringify<IDepartment>(department);
    const expected: string = JSON.stringify(department);

    if (json !== expected)
        throw new Error("Bug on typia.json.stringify(): failed to understand the recursive object.");
}

interface IDepartment
{
    name: string;
    parent: IDepartment | null;
}
```



## Sending a Pull Request
Thanks for your contributing. Before sending a pull request to me, please check those components.

### 1. Include enough descriptions
When you send a pull request, please include a description, of what your change intends to do, on the content. Title, make it clear and simple such below:

  - Refactor features
  - Fix #17
  - Add tests for #28

### 2. Include adequate tests
As I've mentioned in the `Contributing Code` section, your PR should pass the test-automation module. If your PR includes *new features* that have not being handled in the ordinary test-automation module, then also update *add the testing unit* please.

If there're some specific reasons that could not pass the test-automation (not error but *intended*), then please update the ordinary test-automation module or write the reasons on your PR content and *const me update the test-automation module*.
